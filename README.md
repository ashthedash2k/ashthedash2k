## Currently :D
‚ú® student @ cmu studying cs with a concentration of machine learning! <br>

## Qualities I always try to have ü•π 
‚ú® having a growth mindset 
‚ú® being anti fragile 
‚ú® never giving up 
‚ú® fail fast learn mentality
‚ú® making an impact

## What I am currently working on!
‚ú® building an MLP using metal's api. Working on implementing the necessary shaders and adding optimizations including parallelization, loop unrolling, SIMD vectorization, etc. 
‚ú® bench marking my shaders against naive and slightly more optimzied versions 

## Current interests 
‚ú® Metal 
‚ú® Cuda
‚ú® C++
‚ú® PyTorch 

## Failed Projects and what they taught me 
‚ú® Python compiler - I knew this was a sus project but I wanted to try implementing a super small compiler that would be very simple. learned about ASTs and improved my knowledge on x86. It was also so fascinating to explore optimizations. I think Berkley does some version of a compiler for a language close to or a subset of python, in the future I'd probably explore doing something like this.
